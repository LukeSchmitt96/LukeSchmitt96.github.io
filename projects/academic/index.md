# Projects

## [Carnegie Mellon University](#carnegie-mellon-university)

### [Computational Engineering and Robotics Laboratory](#computational-engineering-and-robotics-laboratory)

#### Control Project Group
Jan 2020 - Present

Controller optimization for UAVs operated under windy conditions.

### [16-899 Adaptive Control and Reinforcement Learning](#16-899-adaptive-control-and-reinforcement-learning)
Mar 2020 - May 2020

Implemented imitation learning methods on an extended Kalman filter to improve the state estimation of a simulated quadrotor.

The plot above shows how well the learned methods did compared to the original hand-tuned method. The closer the curve is to the black 
ground truth curve, the better the estimation is.

### [16-868 Biomechanics and Motor Control](#16-868-biomechanics-and-motor-control)

#### Modeling Bipedal Balance Strategies Using Simscape Multibody
Oct 2019 - Dec 2019

Modeled a robust 2D bipedal controller using Simulink that recovers standing balance under disturbances
