<h1>Sampling-Based Planning</h1>

<div>

    <p>This project implements the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rapidly-exploring_random_tree" target="_blank">rapidly-exploring random tree (RRT)</a>
       algorithm to find a path between two nodes in a space while avoiding obstacles.
       This project was written in Python, reusing the node and planner base classes from the A* project.
       The RRT algorithm performs the following steps:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Randomly sample the space (occasionally sampling the goal position). If the sample is occupied by an obstacle, skip.</li>
        <li>Find the node closest to the sample. If the line between the sample and the closest node is intersected by an obstacle, skip.</li>
        <li>Place a new node somewhere between the sample and the closest node.</li>
        <li>Once a continuous path is built to the goal position, add parent nodes to the path working backwards from the goal node.</li>
    </ol>
