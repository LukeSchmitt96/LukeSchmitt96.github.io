<h3 id="college-of-engineering-trajectory-award">College of Engineering Trajectory Award</h3>

<p>Apr 2019 ¬∑ The University of Akron College of Engineering</p>

<p>‚ÄúTrajectory Award recipients are examples of students graduating from the College of Engineering whose talents, along with the help from family, faculty, and peers, have enabled them to succeed. Moreover, in keeping with the tenet that, ‚Äòto whom much is given, much is expected,‚Äô they have demonstrated a willingness to contribute to the wellbeing of others, now and into the future. The Trajectory Award is meant to relieve some of the financial burden that might otherwise hinder them after graduation.</p>

<p>Deserving students are identified based on achievement in academic and extra-curricular, co-curricular, civic and volunteer activities, as well as their potential to become future community leaders. Since its 2012 establishment, the Award has recognized 50 recipients who, through their examples, have advanced a culture of leadership in the College of Engineering.‚Äù</p>
