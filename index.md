# Bio

I am a mechanical engineering master's student attending [Carnegie Mellon University](https://www.cmu.edu/).
Currently, I am working under Dr. Kenji Shimada in the [CERLAB](http://www.andrew.cmu.edu/user/shimada/index.htm) on a project to implement optimal control strategies on a quadrotor under windy conditions during the service and inspection of nuclear plants and facilities.

I graduated from [The University of Akron](https://uakron.edu/) with a BS in mechanical engineering. 
While there, I participated in two design teams, performed undergraduate research with Dr. Marnie Saunders, and aided in recruiting efforts as part of the [College of Engineering Dean's Team](https://www.uakron.edu/engineering/academics/undergraduate/deans-team/18-19/).
